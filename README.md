# Rainbow DQN Implementation

This repository provides a complete implementation of the Rainbow DQN algorithm, incorporating several advanced improvements:
- **Double DQN**
- **Dueling DQN**
- **Noisy DQN**
- **Prioritized DQN**
- **Distributed DQN**
- **Multi-step DQN**

**Note:** The hyperparameters have not been fully optimized and may require further tuning based on your specific application needs.
